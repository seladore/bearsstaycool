### law of prägnanz (gestalt theory)

----

_objects that are similar are more related_

1. proximity -
2. symmetry -
3. common region - scannability improves by grouping like objects
4. continuation -

>There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape)...

----

 >When **Similarity** occurs, an object can get emphasised by being different from the rest; this is called **‘Anomaly’** and can be used to create contrast or visual weight. It can draw the user’s attention to a specific piece of content (focal point) while assisting with scanability, discoverability and the overall flow.

### optical effects/difference
objects don't always look symmetrical even though they are
use intuition to compensate for optical difference
